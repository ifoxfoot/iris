      "contents": "\nI’m originally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where I developed a deep appreciation for nature. Now I live in Truckee, CA where I love to hike, backpack, swim in the mountain streams, and snowboard. I also love to travel, and since graduating college in 2015, I’ve been to fifteen new countries! I funded my adventures by working as a wildlife technician in the summer and working at ski resorts in the winter.\nI’ve had some truly amazing experiences over the years. I’ve monitored carnivore populations in the Southern Sierra Nevada, I’ve trapped and collared fishers, I’ve worked as an outdoor educator, I’ve studied how fuels treatment affects squirrels, and I managed a research project investigating primate behavior in Ethiopia.\nNow I’m a master’s student at UCSB, where I’m studying environmental science and management. I love making beautiful graphs and maps, learning about ecology, and working with my classmates to solve real-world environmental problems!\nHere’s a picture of me with Gelada Monkeys in the Guassa conservation area of Ethiopia\n\n\n",

Before graduate school I spent five years conducting wildlife surveys in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and in the highlands of Ethiopia. During my time as as a wildlife field tech I began to contemplate the interplay between conservation and economic development. I wanted to provide practical solutions that advanced both goals, particularly focusing on land-use change and wildlife conservation. This led me to Bren, where I am specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus on data science and where I hope to develop and implement more sustainable land use practices in forestry and agriculture. You can find me trying out some new code, walking my dogs, or out snowboarding!\n            \n            \n              I’m Iris Foxfoot, a first-year master’s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB.
