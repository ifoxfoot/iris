Before graduate school I spent five years conducting wildlife surveys in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and in the highlands of Ethiopia. During my time as as a wildlife field tech I began to contemplate the interplay between conservation and economic development. I wanted to provide practical solutions that advanced both goals, particularly focusing on land-use change and wildlife conservation. This led me to Bren, where I am specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus on data science and where I hope to develop and implement more sustainable land use practices in forestry and agriculture. You can find me trying out some new code, walking my dogs, or out snowboarding!\n            \n            \n              I’m Iris Foxfoot, a first-year master’s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB.
