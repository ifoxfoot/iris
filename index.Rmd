I'm Iris Foxfoot, a first-year masterâ€™s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. Before graduate school I spent five years conducting wildlife surveys in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and in the highlands of Ethiopia. During my time as as a wildlife field tech I began to contemplate the interplay between conservation and economic development. I wanted to provide practical solutions that advanced both goals, particularly focusing on land-use change and wildlife conservation. This led me to Bren, where I am specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus on data science and where I hope to develop and implement more sustainable land use practices in forestry and agriculture. You can find me trying out some new code, walking my dogs, or out snowboarding!
