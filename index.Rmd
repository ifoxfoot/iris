I'm Iris Foxfoot, a second-year masterâ€™s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. Before graduate school I spent five years conducting wildlife surveys in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and in the highlands of Ethiopia. Now I focus on using data to make informed conservation decisions. You can find me trying out some new code, walking my dogs, or out snowboarding!
